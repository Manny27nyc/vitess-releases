### Vitess Release Roster

Every Wednesday at 12PM PST, a PlanetScale team member takes turns to build and release a Vitess binary.

This process makes it easy for the Vitess community to install and run Vitess without Docker, and without performing a manual build themselves.

Every engineering and product team member will participate in this release roster.

If you need access to `planet-build`, please reach out to the engineering channel on Slack and someone with access to `planet-build` will get your public key added. 

#### Process

1. Follow [Vitess release instructions](vitess-release-instructions.md)
2. Post an update in the #releases channel in the vitess.slack.com workspace. Follow this [message format](https://vitess.slack.com/archives/C0PQY0PTK/p1547500981410100) so that new Vitess Slack users know what these releases are for.
3. Update the roster below with the link to your release
4. Nominate a team member for the following week
